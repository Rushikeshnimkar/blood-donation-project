## Introduction

- A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of whole blood components). Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly (apheresis). Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.

## Inspiration

- Blood banks should act just as their name reflects. When we are healthy, we should be able to save for the future by making deposits. When we inevitably get sick, we should be able to withdrawal on those savings to pay for expenses related to our condition.

- Fast forward to 2020, COVID-19 spreads to a global pandemic and national emergencies are declared in countless countries around the world. Social distancing and quarantines cause blood shortages globally as donations plummet while demand for blood and plasma increases. Blood banks enter a short term shortage all over the world with no lifeline in sight.

- Donations centers across the globe need a way to encourage blood donations based on local demand during a time of crisis. As the demand for blood increases during the crisis, the eligible donor population was told to stay home, isolate, and avoid medical facilities causing a deepened shortage.
